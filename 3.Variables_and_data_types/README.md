# Java Tutorial: Variables and Data Types in Java Programming
- Just like we have some rules that we follow to speak English (the grammar), we have some rules to follow while writing a Java program. This set of these rules is called syntax. Itâ€™s like Vocabulary and Grammar of Java.

### Variables
- A variable is a container that stores a value.
- This value can be changed during the execution of the program.
- Example: int number = 8; (Here, int is a data type, the number is the variable name, and 8 is the value it contains/stores).

### Rules for declaring a variable name
- We can choose a name while declaring a Java variable if the following rules are followed:
- Must not begin with a digit. (E.g., 1arry is an invalid variable)
- Name is case sensitive. (Harry and harry are different)
- Should not be a keyword (like Void).
- White space is not allowed. (int Code With Harry is invalid)
- Can contain alphabets, $character, _character, and digits if the other conditions are met.

### Data Types
Data types in Java fall under the following categories
- Primitive Data Types (Intrinsic)
- Non-Primitive Data Types (Derived)

### Primitive Data Types
- Java is statically typed, i.e., variables must be declared before use. Java supports 8 primitive data types:

### How to choose data types for our variables
- In order to choose the data type, we first need to find the type of data we want to store. After that, we need to analyze the min & max value we might use.
