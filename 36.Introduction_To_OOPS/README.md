# Java Tutorial: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real-world, making the code short and easier to understand.
- With the help of OOPs, we try to implement real-world entities such as object, inheritance, abstraction, etc.
- OOPs helps us to follow the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) approach of programming, which in turn increases the reusability of the code.

### Two most important aspects of OOPs - Classes & Objects :

#### Class :
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
- Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.
- It is a logical component.

#### Objects :
- An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template (info) is defined.
- Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
- It is a physical entity.
- Take a look at the below example to get a better understanding of objects and classes :

### How to model a problem in OOPs
- We identify the following:

```
Noun              - Class                        - Employee
Adjective         - Attributes                   - name, age, salary
Verb              - Methods                      - getSalary(), increment()
```

- This is all for this tutorial. We will do a detailed discussion on every aspect of OOPs in further tutorials.
