- The executable file will start executing.
- Keep clicking on the Next button to install the JDK in default settings.

### Step 3: Downloading IntelliJ IDEA :
- We need an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) to write and debug our code easily.
- IntelliJ IDEA is the best-suited IDE for writing Java code.
- [Click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), and you will be redirected to the official download page of IntelliJ IDEA.
- Download the Community Version of the IntelliJ IDEA as it is free to use.

### Step 4: Installing IntelliJ IDEA :
